1. Buy, build, or re-purpose an enclosure for your radio clock.  Mine
   was made from a section of steel 4" x 4" square tube.

2. Build the external circuitry and attach the Real Time Clock 
   and WWVB modules to the auxiliary circuit board.  Connect 
   leads to the Arduino I/O pins as you go.  Follow the schematic.

3. Wire the connections between the Arduino and the display, a 16x2 
   character LCD in this case.  

4. Download the software and program the Arduino.

5. Set the dip switches to indicate your time zone. (Future.  Time zones
   are not implemented in verison 1 of the WWVB clock code.)

6. Fire up your circuit and test it out.  You should initially see an 
   incorrect time.  As soon as the receiver is able to pull in the 
   WWVB signal - which may take until night fall, especially in RF 
   noisy environments far from Colorado - the display will update 
   to the correct time and indicate that the adjustment has been made.  
   To entertain skeptics, the front panel light will blink in time with 
   each frame received and decoded from WWVB; once per minute when  all 
   is working correctly.

7. Start modifying it.  This circuit is designed around general purpose 
   hardware and deliberately put together with impermanent wiring 
   connections: The Arduino is a general purpose microcontroller and 
   is grafted here to a real time clock, a WWVB receiver module, and a 
   16x2 character LCD.  This is a great starting point for your 
   experiments in timekeeping.
